## What is it?

ClusterPlex is basically an extended version of Plex, which supports distributed Workers across a cluster to handle transcoding requests.

[Plex](https://plex.tv) organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices.

## Components

In order to be able to use multiple nodes for transcoding, it's made up of 3 parts:

* ### Plex Media Server
  There are two alternatives here:
  1. **RECOMMENDED:** Running the Official LinuxServer Plex image (ghcr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest) and applying the ClusterPlex dockermod (ghcr.io/pabloromeo/clusterplex_dockermod:latest)
  2. Running the ClusterPlex PMS docker image (ghcr.io/pabloromeo/clusterplex_pms:latest)
* ### Transcoding Orchestrator
  Running a container using ghcr.io/pabloromeo/clusterplex_orchestrator:latest
* ### Transcoding Workers
  Just as with PMS, two alternatives:
  1. **RECOMMENDED:** Official image (ghcr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest) with the Worker dockermod (ghcr.io/pabloromeo/clusterplex_worker_dockermod:latest)
  2. Custom Docker image: ghcr.io/pabloromeo/clusterplex_worker:latest

## How does it work?

* In the customized PMS server, Plexâ€™s own transcoder is renamed and a shim is put in its place which calls a small Node.js app that communicates with the Orchestrator container over websockets.

* The Orchestrator (Node.js application which receives all transcoding requests from PMS and forwards it to one of the active Workers available over websockets.

* Workers receive requests from the Orchestrator and kick off the transcoding and report progress back to PMS. Workers can come online or go offline and the Orchestrator manages their registrations and availability. These Workers can run as replicated services managed by the cluster.

## Shared content

### Plex Application Data
**WARNING:** PMS's Application Data mount (/config) doesn't need to be shared with the Workers, so you can use your preferred method for persistent storage. However, beware that Plex doesn't play very well with network storage for this, especially regarding symlinks and file locks (used by their sqlite db).

For this reason CIFS/SMB should be avoided for this mount. NFS has been shown to work, but it is very sensitive to how the server and the mount is finetunned through configuration and may not work.

**The recommendation is to use GlusterFS or Ceph**

### Media

In order for Workers to function properly, all Media content should be shared using identical paths between PMS and the Workers.
This would be using network shared storage, such as NFS, SMB, Ceph, Gluster, etc.

### Temp & Transcoding location

The same applies to the **/tmp** directory, in both PMS and the Workers. And the transcoding path configured in Plex should be a subdirectory of **/tmp**.

Such as:

![transcode-path](images/transcode-path.png)

### Codecs

Workers require a path to store downloaded codecs for the particular architecture of the Worker.
Codecs are downloaded as needed, whenever a transcoding request is received.

These can be shared across Workers, if desired, in order to avoid downloading the same codec for each Worker, but it isn't mandatory.

The path within the container is **/codecs**, which you can mount to a volume in order to have them persisted across container recreations. Subdirectories for each plex version and architecture are created within it.
 
## Network settings in PMS ##
In Plex's `Network` Configuration, add Docker's VLAN (or the range that will be used by Workers) to the `"List of IP addresses and networks that are allowed without auth"`.

For example:

# HELP worker_load_cpu Worker Load - CPU usage
# TYPE worker_load_cpu gauge
worker_load_cpu{worker_id="869902cf-5f95-49ec-8d4e-c49ff9bee914",worker_name="NODE1"} 28.13
worker_load_cpu{worker_id="61e06076-4b9e-4d83-bcaa-1385f2d8f414",worker_name="NODE2"} 11.97
